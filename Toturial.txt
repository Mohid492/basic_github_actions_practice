A "workflow" is something that happs when aneven is triggered

The line
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
is a GitHub Actions step that tells the workflow to download (checkout) 
your repository’s code onto the virtual machine where the workflow runs.

In simple terms:
It makes your code available for the next steps (like 
installing dependencies, linting, and testing).
Without this, the workflow wouldn’t have access to your project files.
It just downloads (copies) your code onto GitHub’s virtual machine so 
the workflow can use it for testing, building, or other steps.
